This library is for decoding the DCF77 time signal broadcasted
by the german PTB (Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt) in Mainflingen.

To be able to use this code you have to hook up a special DCF77 receiver 
to your Arduino. I used the one sold be german electronics retailer Reichelt.

Unfortunately the Reichelt module has a very weak push-pull output which only
provides around +/- 5uA. 

To get usable readings out of it I used the following circuit:
                                 ____ 
                            +---|____|---> +5V
                            |    R3
                            |
         ____     |/c-------+------------o PIN2
SIG o---|____|---b|
          R1      |\e-------+
                            |
                            |    ____
VDD o---+-------+-------+---|---|____|---o +5V
        |       |       |   |    R2
       _|_     _|_     _|_  |
    D1 / \  C1 ___  C2 ___  |
        |       |       |   |
GND o---+-------+-------+---+-----------o GND

D1: 3.9 Z-Diode 
C1: 100n Ceramic Capacitor
C2: 100u Electrolytic Capacitor
R1: 120k Resistor
R2: 2.2k Resistor
R3: 10k Resistor

To amplify the signal there is a Transistor between R1 and PIN2.
